                            Inflation is often intepreted as a plague - but is it truly the barrier to our prosperity, 
                            or merely a misunderstood saviour? Well, this question truly is a torture. However, there 
                            exists no absolute correct answer to this question. Instead 
                            debates has been ongoing due to inflation's different effects based on its rate, causes, 
                            and whether its anticipated or not
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lets start off with the very basics; what is inflation? Well in easy words, its how much 
                            more expensive goods become upon certain change in the country's economy. In more technical
                            terms, inflation is the sustained increase in the general price level within an economy over 
                            time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Commonly perceived negatively due to rising prices, it is important that we understand that 
                            inflation holds great responcibility in encouraging investments and incentivising costumer 
                            spending in the contemporary time.

                                Despite severe downsides inflation can bring, the ultimate aim of inflation is to adjust real wages
                                and to encourage investments. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Upon expecting price rise, people would be more willing to engage in Investments due to future expectations
                                of higher prices and thus people are more likely to purchase sooner than later.

                                Furthermore, inflations act as an alternate to wage cuts, reducing employees' real wages while remaining
                                at a constant nominal wage.

                            <p>At elevated levels, inflation pose significant threats to economic stability, and potentially
                                undermining consumer confidence. In extreme cases such as the Zimbabwe or Weimar Republic, 
                                monetary value collapsed so drastically that basic goods becamse unaffordable.

                            “Inflation is unjust and deflation is inexpedient. Of the two, deflation is worse.” - John Maynard Keynes,
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While inflation plays the antagonist, it's true character is far beyond complex. At high and 
                            uncontrollable levels, inflation can lead to economic chrisis and hyperinflation, while on the 
                            controlled and mild end, Inflation can help stimulate demand, enable investiment incentives, and
                            ultimately controlling the real wages of workers within a country.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As stated by Keynes, Inflation is less severe than deflation and should not be feared indiscriminately. 
                            but instead taken as a neccessary, a factor that controls (while effectly utilized) a country's economical
                            health.
